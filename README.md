## Description

It is important to have a directory for your team for quick reference. To this end I've created a Team Profile Generator to simplify this process so all you'll have to focus on are your projects. A sample of how this will look when generated is:
[Sample](./sample.html)

## Installation

All you need to do to get this up and running is download the source code, navigate out to the folder that contains the index.js file, type npm init into the command line, then type npm install inquirer. If you are setting up a repository for this you'll also want to create a .gitignore and add node_modules/ so that those files don't get uploaded to your repository.

## Usage

Once everything is installed the user will simply type node index into the command line and answer the questions. The generated team.html file will be in the /dist folder.

I've also taken the liberty of making a short 5 minute video showing how this is used:
